[![Pythia Live Site](https://img.shields.io/badge/Live_Demo-p--score.me-6366F1?style=for-the-badge&logo=cloudflare)](https://p-score.me)

## 🔮 Overview

**Pythia** is a lightweight, fast, and comprehensive website auditing tool designed to assess the performance, quality, security, and modernity of any given URL. It distills complex analysis across 10 core categories into a single, easy-to-understand metric: the **P-Score**.

The project is architected for speed, utilizing a serverless **Cloudflare Worker** for the heavy-lifting API and a simple, static HTML/JavaScript frontend.

## 🚀 Features

* **Serverless Analysis:** Core scanning logic runs on a **Cloudflare Worker** (`scan-8.js`), ensuring minimal latency and cost-effective operation.
* **Comprehensive Audit:** Checks over a dozen metrics covering everything from SEO and security to modern web features and environmental sustainability.
* **Shareable Badges:** Generates a custom, downloadable image badge of the result for sharing on social media or embedding on a site (powered by `html2canvas` in `index-29.html`).
* **Rivalry Mode:** (As seen in `index-29.html`) Allows users to compare their site directly against a popular target site (e.g., beating `X.com`).
* **Modern Frontend:** Built with minimal HTML and **Tailwind CSS** for a clean, responsive interface.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

| Component | Technology | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Backend/API** | **Cloudflare Workers (JavaScript)** | Handles URL fetching, content analysis, and score calculation. |
| **Frontend UI** | **HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript** | The user-facing page for inputting URLs and displaying results. |
| **Badge Utility** | **html2canvas** | Client-side library used to convert the result badge from HTML to a downloadable PNG image. |

## 🔍 P-Score Analysis Categories

The scoring logic within `scan-8.js` aggregates results from 10 distinct, thematic categories (referred to as "Oracles" in the code) to calculate the final P-Score:

| Category | Focus Area | Key Metrics Analyzed (Example) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Aura** | **Accessibility & Semantics** | `hasImagesWithAlt`, `hasSemanticTags` |
| **Nexus** | **Responsiveness** | `hasViewport` meta tag |
| **Pulse** | **SEO & Metadata** | `hasTitle`, `hasMetaDescription`, `ogTags`, `hasCanonical` |
| **Eden** | **File Size & Efficiency** | Total page `sizeBytes` |
| **Helix** | **Security** | `trackerCount`, Security Headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame) |
| **Nova** | **Performance & Caching** | `isCDN`, `hasCache`, `compression` |
| **Aether** | **Modern Web** | `hasWebAssembly`, `hasServiceWorker`, `hasModules`, `hasWebp` |
| **Quantum** | **Standards Compliance** | `hasDoctype`, `hasDeprecatedTags` |
| **Echo** | **Sustainability** | `isGreenHosted` check |

## ⚙️ Setup and Installation

### 1. Backend API (Cloudflare Worker)

The scoring API is self-contained in `scan-8.js`.

1.  **Create a Worker:** Set up a new Cloudflare Worker service.
2.  **Deploy Code:** Copy the contents of `scan.js` into the Worker script (e.g., rename it to `index.js` if necessary for your deployment).
3.  **Configure API Endpoint:** Ensure your frontend (next step) is configured to send POST requests to the Worker's assigned route/URL.

### 2. Frontend (Static Site)

The user interface is a single-page application based on `index.html`.

1.  **Hosting:** Host `index.html` on any static site hosting service (Cloudflare Pages, Netlify, etc.).
2.  **Configuration:** Update the JavaScript within `index.html` to point the score submission form to the exact URL of your deployed Cloudflare Worker API.

> **CORS Note:** The `scan.js` worker includes standard CORS headers (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: '*'`) to ensure the frontend can successfully communicate with the backend API.
